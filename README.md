## Overview: To provide Dana a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users click-to-filter options. 
In addition to the date, I added table filters for the city, state, country, and shape. :compass:

## Results/Analysis
Welcome to the UFO Sightings page!![index img gh](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106544424/186034823-62e1d358-8547-4ea7-b2ca-ab087f862a6c.png)
In order to begin your search: please float on over to the filtered search section and in lowercase letters enter in the date, city, state, country or shape and click filter.
The website will generate results based on the information you provide. To reset the filter criteria, click the UFO Sightings at the top left of the website.![fltered table img gh](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106544424/186034888-b47f4fea-4f97-4983-be56-2e38b8002b6e.png)


## Summary/Areas for Improvement:
The user must know specific dates, cities, or shapes to search. Some shapes like "light" might not be as intuitive. The filters require correct lower-case spellings and cannot include spaces at the end. 
The city that was used, for example, could not be typed as "lamesa", “la_mesa”, or "La Mesa". The only acceptable input would be "la mesa".![filter result](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106544424/186034904-093725d0-e550-4373-972c-6dac5b8b2a79.png)



Two recommendations (and a bonus) are:
- Make the page upper case/lower case intuitive. If a search were to be for Roswell rather than roswell it would be syntactically correct.
- Allow for a map point to appear when the search results are populated. A google map location would be beneficial to anyone interested in the general global/topography of a search result. 
- A fun bonus to the page would be as the mouse navigates the page add a whimsical ufo icon that travels as the mouse tail.
